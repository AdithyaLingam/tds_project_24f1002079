Project 1

Data Scraping: We used the GitHub API to scrape the data, retrieving user information and repositories for Seattle users with more than 200 followers.We utilized the requests and pandas libraries. For each user, we fetched detailed information such as their name, company, location, email, and performed string manipulation wherever necessary. Additionally, we retrieved up to 500 of their most recently pushed repositories, capturing details like repository name, creation date, and license.

Interesting Fact: Even though they are hireable, most of these top engineers surprisingly do not make their email addresses publicly available.

Actionable Recommendation: Developers should consider making their email addresses public to increase their visibility and potential job opportunities.
