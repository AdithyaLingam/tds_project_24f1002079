Project 1

Data Scraping: We used the GitHub API to scrape the data, retrieving user information and repositories for Seattle users with more than 200 followers.We utilized the requests and pandas libraries. For each user, we fetched detailed information such as their name, company, location, email, and performed string manipulation wherever necessary. Additionally, we retrieved up to 500 of their most recently pushed repositories, capturing details like repository name, creation date, and license.

Interesting Fact: 
1.Even though they are hireable, most of these top engineers surprisingly do not make their email addresses publicly available.
2.MIT License Dominance: The MIT License shows a significant increase in popularity, peaking around 2017 with over 80 repositories.
3.Apache License 2.0: This license also shows a steady increase, particularly from 2011 to 2016, but remains less popular than the MIT License.
Other Licenses such as the ISC License and zlib License have relatively low and stable usage over time.

Actionable Recommendation: Developers should consider making their email addresses public to increase their visibility and potential job opportunities.
